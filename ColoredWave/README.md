matplotlib does not have support for lines with varying color, but this can still be accomplished by using a scatter plot with many points, although it is much more computationally intensive. Eventually I plan to implement this into mplanimations in such a way that colored lines can be created and treated in the same way as normal lines created through the standard `plot` function.
